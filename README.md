# pi coding agent (dockerized)

Almost secure, containerized environment for running the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Designed for local execution with strict file-system isolation, privilege drop, and persistent storage.

## Quick Start

**1. Configuration**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GitHub token and Git identity
```

**2. Build**
Compiles the image from source and strips OS privilege escalation binaries.
```bash
make build
```

**Hotdog build**
Builds the image tag expected by Hotdog Ticket Assistants.
```bash
make hotdog-build
```
This produces:
```txt
hotdog-ticket-assistant:local
```
Hotdog starts per-ticket containers itself with host-provided workspace, agent-run, and wrapper mounts. This repo only provides the hardened image and optional zonzon gateway.

**3. Run**
Starts the agent in interactive TUI mode.
```bash
make run
```

## Usage

**Passing Arguments**
Use the `run-args` target to pass specific flags, commands, or one-off prompts to the agent.
```bash
# Check version
make args="--version" run-args

# Trigger Copilot authentication
make args="/login" run-args

# Execute a direct prompt
make args="'Create a snake game in python'" run-args
```

**Maintenance & Debugging**
```bash
# Access the container shell (runs as user 1000)
make shell

# Stop and remove running containers/networks
make clean

# Force rebuild the image without cache
make update
```

## Offline Mode (llama.cpp)

To run the agent completely offline using local models, configure the following files in your `.pi-data/agent/` directory:

**.pi-data/agent/models.json**
```json
{
  "providers": {
    "llama-cpp": {
      "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "none",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**.pi-data/agent/settings.json**
```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "llama-cpp",
  "defaultModel": "gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF",
  "autocompleteMaxVisible": 7,
  "defaultThinkingLevel": "off"
}
```

## 🔒 Security Architecture & Paranoid Mode

This container implements a defense-in-depth architecture to sandbox the AI agent, ensuring it cannot leak credentials, modify its own access limits, or escalate privileges on your host machine.

### 1. Paranoid Mode (Active by Default)
The container uses a guardrail wrapper (`gh-guard.sh`) around the GitHub CLI. When `PARANOID_MODE=true` (set in `.env`), the agent is strictly blocked from executing dangerous repository or identity commands:
* **Blocked:** `gh auth`, `gh repo`, `gh secret`, `gh ssh-key`, `gh gpg-key`.
* This prevents a rogue agent from injecting a persistent backdoor key into your GitHub account.

### 2. The Micro-Vault (Token Isolation)
Your `GITHUB_TOKEN` is **never** exposed in environment variables where the agent can read it via `process.env`.
* The token is mapped as a Docker Secret into RAM (`tmpfs`) and locked to host permissions `000`.
* The container runs as a standard user (`UID 1000`).
* A custom C binary (`gh-vault`) uses SetUID to briefly elevate to root, read the token, pass it to the GitHub CLI, and immediately drop privileges. The agent natively receives `Permission Denied` if it attempts to read the file.

### 3. Dual Execution Firewalls
To prevent the agent from reading your Copilot `auth.json` or `.env` files, we implemented firewalls at both the OS and Application layers:
* **OS Syscall Firewall (`LD_PRELOAD`):** A custom C library (`fs-vault.so`) intercepts `open()` and `fopen()` syscalls at the Linux kernel level. If the agent spawns native child processes (like `cat`, `grep`, or `python`) to snoop on config directories, the kernel forces an `EACCES` permission error.
* **V8 Application Firewall:** A Node.js monkeypatch (`app-firewall.js`) intercepts the internal `fs` module. It analyzes the execution stack trace in real-time. If a file read/write request originates from the AI agent's tool directory, it throws a hard `[SYSTEM BLOCK]`. It only allows the core application (like the `/login` prompt) to touch credentials.

### 4. OS Binary Purge
During the Docker build phase, all native Linux privilege escalation vectors are physically deleted from the image:
* Removed: `su`, `mount`, `passwd`, `chsh`, `login`, `newgrp`, `unshare`, etc.
* The SetUID/SetGID execution bits are globally stripped (`chmod a-s`) from all remaining binaries on the filesystem.

### 5. Safe Persistence & Writable Space
* **UID/GID Mapping:** The `Makefile` dynamically passes your host User ID and Group ID into the container. Any files the agent writes to the `./workspace` mount will be owned by your host user, preventing root permission lockouts.
* **Anti-Compilation:** Writable temporary directories (`/tmp`, `/.npm`, `/.config`) are mounted using `tmpfs` with the `noexec` flag. This prevents the agent from downloading and executing statically compiled binaries to bypass the `LD_PRELOAD` firewall.
